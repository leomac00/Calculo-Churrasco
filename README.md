# Barbecue calculator

## What is it?

A React based aplication that calculates the amout of food you should buy based on the amount of people attending the event.

## To run this you will need to:

yarn start : run front-end server at http://localhost:3000 ;

## In this project I learned:

I was able to manipulate state variables using hooks and create React components for composing the user interface. This was a simple project just to test a few aspects of react and to get confortable with the syntax.
